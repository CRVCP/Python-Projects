# Arithmetic Sequence Problem Generator

This is a Python-based command-line tool that generates randomized practice problems on **arithmetic sequences**, complete with clean Unicode subscript formatting (e.g., `aₙ`, `a₁`, `a₀`). It is ideal for students, educators, and anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of arithmetic series concepts interactively.

## Features

- Generates **8 types of arithmetic sequence problems**, including:
  1. Finding a specific term
  2. Finding the common difference
  3. Finding the initial term
  4. Writing the general formula
  5. Checking if a number is in the sequence
  6. Solving for \( n \) when a term is given
  7. Finding missing terms from the middle
  8. Real-world pattern application (e.g., staircases)

- Uses Unicode subscripts for better readability (e.g., `a₅ = a₂ + 3·d`)
- Includes step-by-step problem phrasing and clean output
- Loops continuously until the user opts out

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.6+** installed.
2. Save the script as `arithmetic_sequence_trainer.py`
3. Run it from your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python arithmetic_sequence_trainer.py
